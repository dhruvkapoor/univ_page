of this research include the application of a modified space vector pulse width 
modulation (MSVPWM) scheme combined with robust servomechanism control in a 
three-phase four-wire split dc bus inverter and real-time implementation of 
Newton-Raphson Method on digital signal processors for on-line power system 
identification and power flow control of a distributed generation (DG) unit. 
This report addresses digital control strategies of solid-state electric power 
converters for distributed generation applications in both island and 
grid-connected modes. Three major issues of DG, island operation, grid-connected 
operation, and front-end converter control, are discussed with proposed 
solutions and related analysis. In island mode, a control approach is developed 
for a three-phase four-wire transformerless inverter system to achieve voltage 
regulation with low steady state error and low total harmonic distortion (THD) 
and fast transient response under various load disturbances. The control 
algorithm combines robust servomechanism and discrete-time sliding mode control 
techniques. An MSVPWM scheme is proposed to implement the control under Clarke's 
reference frame. The robust stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. In 
grid-connected mode, a real and reactive power control solution is proposed 
based on the proposed voltage control strategy for island operation. The power 
control solution takes advantage of a system parameter identification method and 
a nonlinear feedforward algorithm, both of which are based on Newton-Raphson 
iteration method. The proposed technique also performs gridline current 
conditioning and yields harmonic free grid-line current. A phase locked loop (PLL) 
based algorithm is developed as a part of the solution to handle possible 
harmonic distorted grid-line voltage. In a DG unit with three-phase three-wire 
ac-dc-ac double conversion topology including a controlled power factor 
correction (PFC) front-end rectifier, unbalanced inverter load could cause 
current and voltage fluctuation on the dc bus. Mathematical analysis is 
conducted to disclose the mechanism of the dc bus voltage ripple and a notch 
filter based rectifier control strategy is proposed to eliminate the impact of 
the ripple and yield balanced input current. The effectiveness of the techniques 
proposed in this report is demonstrated by both simulation and experimental 
results. The implementation related technical details are included in the 
specific chapters and attached electronic files.<br>

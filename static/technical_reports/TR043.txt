This paper presents a real time stochastic technique for modeling the load demand of a power system. The modeling core approach discussed here is recursive and needs nominal core storage and computation time. The developed model is used for forecasting one-step-ahead demand of the system. Such forecasts are useful for real time control of generation and spinning reserve assessment. <br>
In addition, a comparison is made between the current industry load modeling practice and the model development by the technique discussed here. This comparison is made through the real time load data of a utility company by using both methods.<br>

In today’s modern world, there exists incessant inclination to improve living 
standards, sophistication and quality of life. Invariably, better living 
standards and sophistication to ameliorate quality of life can be achieved by 
expending more energy. As a result, energy consumption around the globe has 
increased substantially at the beginning of the 21st century. Currently, 
majority of the energy demand around the world is met by combustion of fossil 
fuels
such as coal, oil and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels happens 
through the oxidation of carbon which leads to the generation of carbon dioxide 
gas (CO_2). CO_2 is one of the important greenhouse gases and a major 
anthropogenic contributor to the effect of global warming. Thus, combustion of 
more and more fossil fuels has an unfavorable impact on the environment. 
Moreover, fossil fuel resources are gradually depleting. A solution to this 
problem is to use
alternative environment-friendly power generation methods which will have least 
or ideally zero emissions. Fuel cell is one such emerging technology which can 
meet the extraordinary energy needs of the 21st century. It is a clean energy 
source with low or zero emissions. The various types of fuel cells are 
well-poised to be used as energy sources in different applications such as 
combined heat and power systems, mobile power systems, distributed generation 
systems, mobile telephones, military communications equipments etc. 
Specifically, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is the well-conceived 
candidate for developing distributed generation power systems and hybrid 
electric vehicles.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><font size="3">

this technical report, dynamic modeling of PEM fuel cell is presented. First, 
various types of fuel cells are described in detail. Their principle of 
operation, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed. Then, nonlinear state 
space model of 500-W PEM fuel cell is proposed. The open-circuit output voltage 
of PEM fuel cell, irreversible voltage losses in PEM fuel cell, effect of 
formation of double layer charge is modeled. Further, dynamic behavior of PEM 
fuel cell is analyzed under different loading conditions and transient response 
of PEM fuel cell during short-time range and long-time range are analyzed.<P align="left">

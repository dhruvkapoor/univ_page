Smart Grids are one of the solutions proposed to handle today’s increasing energy demands in a reliable, efficient, and clean fashion. Smart Grids often utilize a number of sources that are not a part of the main utility supply to either augment the supply, or to feed power back to the mains. This report attempts to develop a system for modeling of a solar cell array that would likely function as a part of an entire smart grid installation. The objective is to develop in thorough detail a method to find the parameters of the single-exponential model using only values provided in the data sheet of the panel. The report expounds step by step modeling procedure with clarity and in greater mathematical detail, and provides a thorough and intensive set of algorithms to successfully solve the equations developed herein.<P align="left">

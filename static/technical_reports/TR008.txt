procedure is developed to estimate and track the stability parameters of
a synchronous generator from time-domain on-line response data. In order
to accurately estimate the parameters of the machine model at various test
and operating conditions, a multistage identification procedure is proposed.
This procedure is verified experimentally by performing both small- and
large-disturbance tests on a 7.5 kVA, 220 V, 1800 rpm synchronous generator.</FONT>

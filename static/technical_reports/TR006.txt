</FONT></I></B>This technical report describes the design and implementation
of an experimental system that can be used for the development and evaluation
of speed sensorless vector control of an induction machine. The system
is based on a single board controller which combines the computing power
of a Texas Instrument 32-bit floating point TMS320C31 DSP with the peripherals
needed to implement the vector control drive. Two sensorless vector control
techniques have been chosen to be evaluated on the experimental system.
The techniques are based on the rotor-flux based Model Reference Adaptive
System (MRAS) and the back-emf based MRAS speed estimators. Practical issues
related with the implementation of these two MRAS speed estimators have
been investigated both in simulation and experimental environments, and
the results are presented in this thesis.</FONT>

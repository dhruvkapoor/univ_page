This report is concerned with the control strategy for the parallel operation of distributed generation systems (DGS) in a standalone AC power supply. The proposed control method uses only low-bandwidth data communication signals between each generation system in addition to the locally measurable feedback signals. This is achieved by combining two control methods: droop control method and average power control method. The average power method with slow update rate is used in order to overcome the sensitivity about voltage and current measurement errors. Additionally, a combined voltage control loop using Perfect Robust Servo-Mechanism and Discrete Time Sliding Mode current controller is designed for each converter to ensure low THD output voltages. The voltage control loop also allows a harmonic control droop scheme which ensures proper sharing of harmonic components of load currents. Simulation studies using two parallel three-phase PWM inverters (600 kVA) are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control</FONT>

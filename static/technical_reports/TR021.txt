Due to the working principle, the torque generated in a switched reluctance motor is a highly nonlinear function of both phase currents and rotor position; and the torque generated by each phase is a discontinuous one. This makes it difficult to get a ripple-free resultant torque. For some applications such as electric brake system, the switched reluctance motor needs to be operated in four quadrants of the torque-speed plane. This brings more difficulties into controlling the torque and minimizing torque ripple.<br>
In this report, four-quadrant operation of an 8/6 SRM is introduced. And the techniques used to control the output torque and minimize torque ripple are described in detail, as well as the results of simulation. These techniques have been applied to an electric brake system that uses SR motor, and satisfactory results were obtained.

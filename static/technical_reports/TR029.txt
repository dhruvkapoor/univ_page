Proper heat sink design is a critical issue in new technology. Developments
in power electronics have resulted to power devices with high current capabilities,
which in turn dissipate considerable heat. If the dissipated heat is not
removed effectively from the power devices, it will make degradation in
the electrical quality of the device or even cause to thermal failure of
the device; thus, simulating the thermal model of the system becomes very
importance regarding the reliability issues.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3>The aim of this project is to simulate the electrothermal
model of a 3Ph IGBT power inverter, including the thermal and electrical
model of the DC voltage source, the inverter bridge and the load, and check
if the designed heat sink can operate properly even in the case of a fault
and the device would not encounter a thermal failure in expected conditions.
Simulation of the electrothermal model gives the thermal distribution in
different points inside the chip, the package and the heat sink. It is
also possible to see the effect of varying the heat sink parameters on
the thermal distribution inside the chip. Another interesting feature of
electrothermal simulation is that the temperature waveforms can be obtained
for different load conditions.</FONT>

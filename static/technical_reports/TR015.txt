<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0><I>ABSTRACT:</I> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3>A sensorless
torque control system for induction motors was developed in this research.
The system allows for fast and precise torque tracking over a wide range
of speed. Unlike most research in the area, the authors used an induction
motor model that adapts its parameters to the operating conditions. An
adaptive sliding mode observer is developed for speed observation and a
cascade of discrete time sliding mode controllers is used for flux and
current control. A least-square estimation speed estimation method is used
at very low speed (below 20 rpm). Simulation and experimental results prove
the validity of the approach.</FONT>

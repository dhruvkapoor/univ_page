This laboratory is designed to provide first time users of TI DSP TMS320F240 with fundamental experiments in the use of digital signal processor based systems for control of electric machines and power electronic drives.<br>
This report covers introduction to laboratory hardware, software, and assembly language programming, digital interfacing (general purpose digital I/O and relays and switches interfacing), timer operations and interrupt systems (programming the timer functions including comparison, input capture, and pulse-width modulator, application of timer functions including time delay, waveform generation and frequency measurement), analog interfacing (A/D and D/A operations and programming), stepper motor drive and shaft encoder (stepper motor drive circuits and encoders operations and interfacing), DC motor speed control (base drive and power converter circuits and open loop speed control), serial communication and programming for data transfer, and generation of a sine modulated PWM signal.<br>
Chapters 1 and 2 are the introduction of TI DSP TMS320F240 and assembly language programming fundamentals with example programs. From Chapter 3, each chapter contains objectives and general introductions, detailed operating principles, device architectures, register descriptions, peripheral circuitry descriptions, example programs, and laboratory procedures and assignments. This report consists of 309 pages.

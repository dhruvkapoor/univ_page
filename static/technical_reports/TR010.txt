the optimal design of the 3-phase, 4-pole, 12-slot permanent magnet synchronous
generator (PMSG) for minimum power losses and minimum machine weight. This
PMSG will be used in the dual voltage generating system, which is required
to minimize power losses, weight, and cost. The LaGrange multiplier method
is mainly employed to solve the inequality constrained optimization problems,
using MATLAB programs. The optimal machine geometry is finally provided
basing on the appropriate selected machine parameters, which give lowest
minimum power losses and minimum machine weight. In addition, electrical
and magnetic designs, including methodology of general design, winding
designs, and PMSG modeling are also covered. The equations of load line,
permeance coefficient, magnet thickness, voltage constant, power losses,
machine weight, resistance per phase, self inductance per phase, temperature
rises, maximum output current, and efficiency are analytically derived
in this thesis.</FONT>

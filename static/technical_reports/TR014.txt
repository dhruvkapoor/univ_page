<B><FONT SIZE=3><I>ABSTRACT:</I> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3>Three control
strategies are implemented and compared in this research: Vector Control,
Continuous Time Sliding Mode Control and Discrete Time Sliding Mode Control
of an induction motor. The induction motor model takes into account magnetizing
inductance saturation and rotor resistance variation. While the magnetizing
inductance is mapped to the operating conditions, the rotor resistance
is estimated on-line. The motor is controlled with optimal efficiency flux.
Flux weakening is employed above rated speed. The controllers are designed
using simulation results. The simulation environment accounts for parameter
mismatches. Several tests are performed on the experimental setup, accounting
for low speed, high speed and rated speed operation. The experiments show
the advantages and disadvantages of the control methods in respect to dynamic
response, parameter mismatches, ease of implementation (algorithm complexity
and tuning), stability of output(chaterring).</FONT>

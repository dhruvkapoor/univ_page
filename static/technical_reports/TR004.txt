introduction of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnetic materials brushless
permanent magnet (PM) machines have found use in a wide variety of high
performance applications. Various compositions of this magnetic material
can produce larger flux densities than other PM materials previously used
in brushless machines, even under more adverse demagnetization conditions.
These properties make NdFeB permanent magnets suitable for variable speed
drive and high precision control applications.</FONT>

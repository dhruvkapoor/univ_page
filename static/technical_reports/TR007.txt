automobile technology has taken great strides in recent years with the
popularity of pure-electric vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles. These
vehicles are in demand because of consumer and government requirements
for a cleaner more fuel efficient vehicle. These advancements toward an
electric and hybrid vehicle marketplace affect many areas of the automobile.
One area that is affected is the automobile. s power steering system. Conventional
power steering systems provide assist to the driver of the automobile by
using hydraulic pressure that is created by a pump that is directly connected
to the engine. This hydraulic pump is continuously putting a load on the
engine even when zero steering assist is required. This type of power steering
system includes parasitic losses that decrease the fuel efficiency of the
car. Also, in some cases, particularly with a pure electric vehicle there
is no engine to drive a hydraulic pump. Hence, there is a need for an engine
independent power steering system. One solution that fits this need is
the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system.</FONT>

methodology to estimate armature circuit and field winding parameters of

a synchronoususing the synthetic

data obtained by the machine natural <I>abc</I> frame of reference simulation

is presented. First, a one-machine infinite bus system including the machine

and its excitation system is simulated in <I>abc</I> frame of reference

by using parameters provided by the machine manufacturer. A proper data

set required for estimation is collected by perturbing the field side of

the machine in small amounts. The recursive maximum likelihood (RML) estimation

technique is employed for the identification of armature circuit parameters.

Subsequently, based on the estimates of armature circuit parameters, the

field winding and some damper parameters are estimated using an Output

Error Estimation (OEM) technique. For each estimation case, the estimation

performance is also validated with noise corrupted measurements.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>The

study shows that noise corruption problems can be effectively handled with

the RML algorithm for estimation of armature circuit parameters.. For lower

signal to noise ratio(<I>SNR)</I> values, the RML estimates of mutual inductances

and field to stator turns ratio has been estimated. The OEM estimation

results reveal that good estimates of the actual parameters can be obtained

with proper initialization. It is shown that for large

excitation disturbances, the OEM estimation technique can recover the model

parameters with unobservable state from noise corrupted data.</FONT>

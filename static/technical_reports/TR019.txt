This report describes the<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;<B><I>ABSTRACT</I></B>:This report describes the
design and implementation of an experimental setup for Field Oriented Control
(FOC) of permanent magnet machine based on a DSP (Digital Signal Processor)
system manufactured by Texas Instruments. The DSP system integrates into
a single board the computational power of a TMS320F240 DSP with extra peripherals
needed in vector control application, and therefore requires minimal hardware
development. The control algorithm implemented is the discrete time sliding
mode control. Simulation and Experimental results are presented. A technique
for position sensorless control is also discussed in this report.</FONT>
